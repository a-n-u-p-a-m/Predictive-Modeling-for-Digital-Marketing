# Predictive-Modeling-for-Digital-Marketing

In this repository I have implemented predictive models and done some data analysis on dataset related to digital marketing campaign.

The repository consists of three files:
1. The Python Notebook which contains a thorough implementation of the methodology and techniques as well as visualized results.
2. The report file which contains a brief step-by-step explanation of the process and the methoddology.
3. The csv file which consists of the dataset that is used in this project.
